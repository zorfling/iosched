      "description": "Running an experiment in space usually requires custom hardware to be launched into orbit at enormous cost. ArduSat is a project designed to change that, by maintaining a fleet of general purpose experimental satellites in orbit and allowing anyone with an interest in space science to design and run their own experiments right from their computer. The first three ArduSat satellites have already been launched and many more are on the way. Jonathan Oxer designed the general purpose experiment module called the Payload Processor Module that was launched into orbit in ArduSat-1 and ArduSat-X, allowing anyone from hobbyists and school students to professional researchers to run their own experiments in space. In this talk he'll explain the background of the ArduSat project, the CubeSat satellite architecture, how satellites get into orbit, and the operation of the Payload Processor Module, showing how you can run your very own experiments in orbit.",

      "description": "WWDC 14 has been called the most important WWDC since the announcement of the original SDK in 2008. Apple announced a new language, additions to the APIs available, and structural changes to iOS codebases. This presents a set of challenges to codebases of substantial size which were structured according to best practices in previous versions of iOS. If you must maintain a legacy application with backwards compatibility, what improvements are available to you and which are dead ends? \n\nThe situation is still in flux. We intend this talk to clarify the situation for developers and project managers so that they know what is easy, difficult or impossible when transitioning legacy projects to Swift and iOS8",

Creating a whole new customer channel, that is effectively the bank’s most highly visited branch, comes with a whole different set of challenges including: \n* Shifting the businesses mindset from a one-off project to treating mobile as a first-class channel that needs to be supported and evolved on an ongoing basis. \n* Provide all the features that customer’s expect from web banking and deliver those in a lean fashion, with a mobile first approach. \n* Balancing security and fraud constraints whilst still making the app easy to use for customers. \n* Pushing the boundaries of traditional brand guidelines that didn’t translate to native mobile environments. \n\nWith a conservative financial institution that’s just beginning to understand how mobile is going to revolutionise its business, you have quite a mountain to climb before your designs can see the light of the app store. \n\nThis is the journey that Toby Pritchard (Suncorp) and Ben Melbourne (ThoughtWorks) have recently been through.

The talk will focus on the technical aspects of the hardware and software evolution, but some context of the startup business will be discussed to frame the conversation.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Smash began as a generic prototype used to gather data around tennis play. Countless hours of data gathering and analysis was done over a 12 month period. You’ll see a demonstration of how the prototype works, the raw data, and the pattern matching heuristics that evolved from the process. The details of the sensors inside the device and the technical trade-offs will be discussed.\n\nFollowing the prototype stage, the device underwent a physical transformation through engagements with manufacturing and industrial design companies. You’ll see that evolution and the final design prototype.\n\nWith all of those pieces in place, there’s also the challenge of creating some useful software for consumers to provide genuine value. You’ll see the software design process, and hear the story about how that is progressing.\n\nSmash ran a kickstarter campaign during June & July in an attempt to raise money for the first full manufacturing run and development of the software. You’ll hear about whether that was a success or not, and some thoughts on why it turned out the way it did.",

      "description": "Microservices are all the buzz for backend development, but can the same lessons be applied to how we develop apps on the client side? In this presentation, I'll show approaches for splitting up your iOS code to make it easier to maintain your code, isolate legacy Objective C and adopt frameworks and tools from iOS 7 and 8 without having to rewrite your app from scratch. The content will help inform how new apps can be developed as well as how to evolve existing an codebase. \n\nWith the rapid pace of change on the iOS platform, we need to start thinking of our apps in terms of smaller components that we can develop, iterate or throw away quickly. I present some of the approaches used on the REA apps and elsewhere. The presentation will be based on the general principles and benefits of composing systems from smaller services, and how that applies to iOS application, including: \n\n* examples of the use of microservices in REA backend systems to promote rapid development and deployment of new functionality \n* groups of functionality that can be thought of as a client-side microservice, and how to manage these dependencies \n* workspace and project structures to develop apps from smaller components, for both iOS 7 and 8 using static libraries, cocoapods or frameworks \n* configuration to allow for multiple features to be developed in parallel \n* approaches for automated testing to allow these smaller components to be developed without the need to manually test the entire application \n* tools to quickly bootstrap new iOS libraries and integrate them into your existing projects \n* examples of using this approach for building 1form.com.au components into the realestate.com.au apps",

      "description": "In the world of mobile app development, web apps have seemed like an annoying younger sibling: always nagging for attention but not really grown-up enough to play with the big kids. However, just like a real kid-brother or sister, mobile web apps have grown up in recent years. For certain classes of application they now represent a viable proposition, and can even be superior in some circumstances.\n\nThe goal of this presentation is to give attendees an accurate picture of the current state of mobile web development, especially in relation to the native app development world. Attendees will learn what’s possible with the mobile web today, and when it might be preferable to use web technologies to build a mobile app instead of writing it natively. They’ll also learn best-practices in mobile web development, when and how frameworks can help, and when it’s appropriate to build a hybrid app that uses both native and web technologies. \n\nI’ll start with a summary of the current state of mobile web development, talking about how advances in both hardware and web standards over the last couple of years are now enabling a whole new class of mobile web application. \n\nNext I’ll move onto guidelines for when to go native and when to go web. This will include coverage of the limitations of Javascript, CSS3, and mobile browsers in general. We’ll discuss the pros and cons of distributing an app over the web vs an app store. Finally, we’ll compare the development effort of native vs. web development. \n\nAfter that I’ll talk about best practices in mobile app development. This will include a discussion about single-page web apps and their associated frameworks, minimising download and startup times, reducing latency during user interactions, and maximising animation performance. \n\nFinally, I’ll discuss when a hybrid approach (i.e. a web app within a native app) can be useful, from both an app-distribution and hardware-access perspective. This will include a discussion of when a wrapper framework (for example, Phonegap) can be useful, as opposed to just doing it all yourself.",
