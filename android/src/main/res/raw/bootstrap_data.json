      "description": "Running an experiment in space usually requires custom hardware to be launched into orbit at enormous cost. ArduSat is a project designed to change that, by maintaining a fleet of general purpose experimental satellites in orbit and allowing anyone with an interest in space science to design and run their own experiments right from their computer. The first three ArduSat satellites have already been launched and many more are on the way. Jonathan Oxer designed the general purpose experiment module called the Payload Processor Module that was launched into orbit in ArduSat-1 and ArduSat-X, allowing anyone from hobbyists and school students to professional researchers to run their own experiments in space. In this talk he’ll explain the background of the ArduSat project, the CubeSat satellite architecture, how satellites get into orbit, and the operation of the Payload Processor Module, showing how you can run your very own experiments in orbit.",

      "description": "WWDC 14 has been called the most important WWDC since the announcement of the original SDK in 2008. Apple announced a new language, additions to the APIs available, and structural changes to iOS codebases. This presents a set of challenges to codebases of substantial size which were structured according to best practices in previous versions of iOS. If you must maintain a legacy application with backwards compatibility, what improvements are available to you and which are dead ends? The situation is still in flux. We intend this talk to clarify the situation for developers and project managers so that they know what is easy, difficult or impossible when transitioning legacy projects to Swift and iOS8",

      "description": "Android is becoming the OS of choice for those needing an easy to use embedded operating system. I’ve spent the last 2.5 years building customised versions of Android to run on various devices for use in the digital signage. In this talk, I’ll cover the basics of what’s involved in customising Android to work as an embedded OS, with examples for things like video-walls and interactive kiosks and then look at how that can then be extended to sensors and outputs to let your Android device interact with the world and people around it. There will be code examples, tips for potential pitfalls and coverage of some of the lessons learnt while building devices that are used by opeople out in the real world vs testers in labs.",

NoSQL databases offer a compelling alternative in web applications, but developers seem firmly attached to a relational model on the device. There are a number of scenarios where this can deliver sub-optimal outcomes, such as query performance and data sync. This presentation will cover these issues and present a few alternatives, focusing on practical demonstrations of specific NoSQL approaches on iOS, however the concepts are highly applicable to other mobile platforms.",

The typical agricultural environment is not friendly to electronics, lacks traditional infrastructure such as readily available power and ubiquitous network access. And yet, pervasive monitoring and control combined with cloud based applications and big data analytics offers productivity gains that our world-wide agricultural production systems desperately need. In order to move beyond the enthusiast scale, and deliver these benefits at large scale a business has to move beyond the maker model, and deliver scalable, robust systems that can survive in all manner of environmental conditions, delivering predictable & reliable results.",

      "description": "In the world of mobile app development, web apps have seemed like an annoying younger sibling: always nagging for attention but not really grown-up enough to play with the big kids. However, just like a real kid-brother or sister, mobile web apps have grown up in recent years. For certain classes of application they now represent a viable proposition, and can even be superior in some circumstances. The goal of this presentation is to give attendees an accurate picture of the current state of mobile web development, especially in relation to the native app development world. Attendees will learn what’s possible with the mobile web today, and when it might be preferable to use web technologies to build a mobile app instead of writing it natively. They’ll also learn best-practices in mobile web development, when and how frameworks can help, and when it’s appropriate to build a hybrid app that uses both native and web technologies. I’ll start with a summary of the current state of mobile web development, talking about how advances in both hardware and web standards over the last couple of years are now enabling a whole new class of mobile web application. Next I’ll move onto guidelines for when to go native and when to go web. This will include coverage of the limitations of Javascript, CSS3, and mobile browsers in general. We’ll discuss the pros and cons of distributing an app over the web vs an app store. Finally, we’ll compare the development effort of native vs. web development. After that I’ll talk about best practices in mobile app development. This will include a discussion about single-page web apps and their associated frameworks, minimising download and startup times, reducing latency during user interactions, and maximising animation performance. Finally, I’ll discuss when a hybrid approach (i.e. a web app within a native app) can be useful, from both an app-distribution and hardware-access perspective. This will include a discussion of when a wrapper framework (for example, Phonegap) can be useful, as opposed to just doing it all yourself.",

Through the power of JavaScript APIs, frameworks and open web APIs, JavaScript developers can expand their existing skill set to empower devices and technology poised to enter the homes and attire of the future. In this presentation, I’ll provide an overview of how JavaScript developers can get involved with technology such as Ninja Blocks, Arduinos, the Leap Motion, Android (via on{X}), the Pebble Watch and more. It will provide an overview of the Internet of Things ecosystem from the perspective of the JavaScript development community. My presentation will begin with an overview of technology that can use JavaScript in one way or another, whether as its primary form of scripting or as a supporting technology bringing further capabilities to the device. I’ll be covering technology such as Ninja Blocks, Arduinos, the Leap Motion, Android (via on{X}), the Pebble Watch, Google Glass (via Wearscript), Oculus Rift (via vr.js), Raspberry Pi, awe.js, Tessel, Espruino and the Myo armband.",
